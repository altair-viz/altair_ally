# Altair ally

Altair ally is an companion package to Altair,
which provides a less verbose syntax to create a few common plots
for exploratory data analysis (EDA).
The goal is to encourage good EDA habits
by making a few common plots easier to make
and to provide useful default interactions with these EDA plots.
The focus is on plots that require the creation of grids of subplots,
such as pairplots / scatterplot matrices.

Thanks to the excellent API in Altair / Vega-Lite,
some configuration is possible by using the built-in methods of the returned chart objects,
but the general philosophy is that highly customized plots
are better made in Altair directly.

Check out the examples section to get started.
